This is (for now) an exercise in architecure and design

The project is based on a plot feature in the anime [Robotics;Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Robotics;Notes_episodes), in which characters used an augmented reality app on their smartphones called IRUO to extend online content into the "real world" depending on geroraphic location.

My objective is to conceptualize the framework of a system that could acoomplish this outside of fiction.
